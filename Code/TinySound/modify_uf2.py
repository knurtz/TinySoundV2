"""

This tool modifies a UF2 file by cutting off all blocks outside a certain flash region, defined by a limit address.
The program looks for the first block of data with a target address bigger or equal to the limit and only copies the blocks before this one to a new UF2 file.
The input file therefore needs to have all blocks in sequential order to function properly.

Syntax: p<thon modify_uf2.py [FILENAME] [LIMIT_ADDRESS]        # address can either be DEC or 0xHEX
